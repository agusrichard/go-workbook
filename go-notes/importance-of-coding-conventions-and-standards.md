Coding standards are a series of procedures for a particular programming language specifying a programming style, the methods, and different procedures.
A coding standard makes sure that all the developers working on the project are following certain specified guidelines. The code can be easily understood and proper consistency is maintained.
> **The finished program code should look like that it has been written by a single developer, in a single session.**

#### While formulating a code, the following should be kept in mind
- Easy to read
   - Define different sections of code by segmenting blocks of code.
   - Use indentation to mark the start and end of a code segment.
- Consistent about naming conventions. Whether they are directories, files, variables, functions, classes or any coding entities.
- Name the functions according to what they perform
- Make any segments of code to be self-explained by looking at it. No need to ask who write this segment of code to understand what it does.
- Follow a specific method for commenting on the work
- Avoid complicated code then complex code

#### Advantaes of Implementing Coding Standards
- Enhanced ffficiency
- Risk of project failure is reduced
- Minimal complexity
- Easy to maintain
- Bug rectification
- A comprehensive look
- Cost efficient

#### Best practices for better codes
- Code comments and proper documentation </br>
It is advisable to start every method or routine with the comment specifying what a routine, method or a function does, about its various parameters, its return values, errors and exceptions (if any).
- Use indentation </br>
There is no particular style to be followed in general. We can make our own style, but make sure that we follow this style consistently.
- Avoid commenting on obvious things. </br>
Comments are good, but too much of them will lead us to chaos. We should avoid write comments on obvious things, or if our code is self-explained then no need to add comments.
- Grouping code </br>
Remember that high cohesion code is good. Small and simple code is easy to manage and considered to be better.
- Proper and consistent scheme for naming
Choose one naming scheme and stick with it for the rest of the project.
- Principles of DRY </br>
The good practice is to write our own code and don't copy-paste too frequently.
- Avoid deep nesting structure
Complex logic can be considered as lack of clarity and hard to understand.
- Use short line length </br>
This makes sure our code easy and comfortable to read.
- Proper organizations of files and folders.
- Refactoring code </br>
We have to implement the Open/Close Principle which basically states our code is closed for modification but open for extension.

## [Why are coding standards important?](https://medium.com/leafgrowio-engineering/why-is-coding-standards-important-319fce79d1a4) <span id="content-2"></span>

When we write code, we need to make sure that any developer can understand it easily, including ourselves in the future.

Coding standards are agreed-with guides of the best-practices that developers have decided to follow when writing code for a project — it says how we must write code so the project is coded in a consistent style and makes it easier for everybody in the team to understand, follow and maintain.

> Get together, and choose an approach that fits the best on your team’s expectation.

At the end of the day what is important is that the source code that your team produces is clean, consistent and easy to maintain by existing developers and those that will follow you in the future.

In short, code style standards are:
- Easy to read
- Easy to understand
- Easy to maintain
