# Conventions and Guidelines

## Intro
Coding standards are a series of procedures for a particular programming language specifying a programming style, the methods, and different procedures.
A coding standard makes sure that all the developers working on the project are following certain specified guidelines. The code can be easily understood and proper consistency is maintained.
> **The finished program code should look like that it has been written by a single developer, in a single session.**

### In general, best practices of better code:
- Code comments and proper documentation </br>
  It is advisable to start every method or routine with the comment specifying what a routine, method or a function does, about its various parameters, its return values, errors and exceptions (if any).
- Use indentation </br>
  There is no particular style to be followed in general. We can make our own style, but make sure that we follow this style consistently.
- Avoid commenting on obvious things. </br>
  Comments are good, but too much of them will lead us to chaos. We should avoid write comments on obvious things, or if our code is self-explained then no need to add comments.
- Grouping code </br>
  Remember that high cohesion code is good. Small and simple code is easy to manage and considered to be better.
- Proper and consistent scheme for naming
  Choose one naming scheme and stick with it for the rest of the project.
- Principles of DRY </br>
  The good practice is to write our own code and don't copy-paste too frequently.
- Avoid deep nesting structure
  Complex logic can be considered as lack of clarity and hard to understand.
- Use short line length </br>
  This makes sure our code easy and comfortable to read.
- Proper organizations of files and folders.
- Refactoring code </br>
  We have to implement the Open/Close Principle which basically states our code is closed for modification but open for extension.
